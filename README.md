# sprout-wrap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap)

## Prerequisites

[Download](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/) and install XCode or the XCode command line tools.

## Installation

To provision your machine, open up Terminal and enter the following:

```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap.git
cd sprout-wrap
caffeinate ./sprout
```

The `caffeinate` command will keep your computer awake while installing; depending on your network connection, soloist can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours to complete.

## Problems?

### clang error

If you receive errors like this:

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-multiply_definedsuppress'

then try downgrading those errors like this:

    sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future bundle

### Command Line Tool Update Server

If you receive a message about the update server being unavailable and are on Mavericks, then you already have the command line tools.

## Customization

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a subset of the recipes in sprout's cookbooks.

[Fork it](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap/fork) to 
customize its [attributes](http://docs.chef.io/attributes.html) in [soloistrc](/soloistrc) and the list of recipes 
you'd like to use for your team. You may also want to add other cookbooks to its [Cheffile](/Cheffile), perhaps one 
of the many [community cookbooks](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks). By default it configures an OS X 
Mavericks workstation for Ruby development.

Finally, if you've never used Chef before - we highly recommend you buy &amp; watch [this excellent 17 minute screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/339-chef-solo-basics) by Ryan Bates. 

## Caveats

### Homebrew

- Homebrew cask has been [integrated](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/15381) with Homebrew proper. If you are experiencing problems installing casks and
  have an older installation of Homebrew, running `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` should fix things.
- If you are updating from an older version of sprout-wrap, your homebrew configuration in soloistrc might be under `node_attributes.sprout.homebrew.formulae`
  and `node_attributes.sprout.homebrew.casks`. These will need to be updated to `node_attributes.homebrew.formulas` (note the change from formulae to formulas)
  and `node_attributes.homebrew.casks`.
